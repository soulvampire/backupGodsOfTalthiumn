# crystals-of-the-gods
Platformer game code written in melonjs, for a web game project
the game will have 4 worlds 
(castle world) knights of the white rose tasked with protecting justice and peace
(forest world) elves of Myshialki tasked with protecting the forest from evil creatures
(ruined world) where chaos corrupted one of the crystals and spawned evil creatures
(desert world) nomads of the Blind Eye tasked with protecting travllers on the way to the
fountains of Talithumn some of the details may change as I write the story of each world 
will have a platformer based game play the player can chose 1 or 5 classes wizard, warrior,
ranger, dwarf, witch.
